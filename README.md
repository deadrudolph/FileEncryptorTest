Just playing around with encryption and decryption. Encrypts any file from External storage using AES symmetric key encryption. 
Then it uses RSA asymmetric key encryption to encrypt AES key. Then it allows user to save a private RSA key to his device to use it later for the file decryption.
This app is just a code snippet which can be used later in client-server communication where we use bot AES and RSA keys to encrypt and decrypt data.
